   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/lazniak/comfyui-google-photos-loader.git
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setting up Google Photos API

To use this node, you need to set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Photos Library API:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Enable the Google Photos Library API for your project.
4. Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client ID) for a desktop application.
5. Download the client configuration and save it as `client_secrets.json` in the same directory as the custom node files.

## Usage

1. In ComfyUI, you'll find several new nodes related to Google Photos.
2. Drag and drop the desired node into your workflow canvas.
3. Connect the node to your workflow as needed.
4. Configure the node settings according to your requirements.
5. Run your workflow. The node will authenticate with Google Photos on first use.

## Node Types

### Google Photos Album Lister
- Lists all albums in your Google Photos library.
- Outputs album information including ID, title, and item count.

### Google Photos Album Selector
- Allows you to select a specific album from the list generated by the Album Lister.
- Outputs the selected album ID for use in other nodes.

### Google Photos Album Loader
- Loads images from a specified album.
- Customizable options for image size, count, and processing.

### Google Photos Images Loader
- Loads images from your entire Google Photos library.
- Supports advanced filtering options like content categories and date ranges.

### Google Photos Cache Manager

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication issues, use the Login/Logout node to reset your authentication.
- Ensure your `client_secrets.json` file is correctly placed and formatted. (IMPORTANT!!! NAME SHOULD HAVE "s" rather then original file was secret in this case use secrets)
- Check the ComfyUI console for detailed logs if you enable the "Advanced Logs" option in the nodes.
- If you're experiencing performance issues, try using the Cache Manager node to optimize your local cache.
