## Description

The Google Photos Loader for ComfyUI is a custom node that allows users to seamlessly integrate Google Photos into their ComfyUI workflows. This powerful tool enables direct access to your Google Photos library, making it easy to list albums, load images from specific albums, and search for photos based on queries - all within your ComfyUI environment.

## Features

- üìÅ List all Google Photos albums
- üñºÔ∏è Load images from a specific album
- üîç Search for photos using queries (under development)
- üõ†Ô∏è Customize image loading options (size, cropping, etc.)
- üîÑ Sort images by creation time, filename, or randomly
- ‚ö° Efficient caching mechanism for improved performance

## Installation

1. Ensure you have ComfyUI installed and set up.
2. Clone this repository into your ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/comfyui-google-photos-loader.git
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setting up Google Photos API

To use this node, you need to set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Photos Library API:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Enable the Google Photos Library API for your project.
4. Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client ID) for a desktop application.
5. Download the client configuration and save it as `client_secrets.json` in the same directory as the custom node files.

## Usage

1. In ComfyUI, locate the new node called "Google Photos Images Loader üì∑".
2. Drag and drop the node into your workflow canvas.
3. Connect this node to your workflow as needed.
4. Configure the node settings:
   - Choose an action: List Albums, Load from Album, or Search Photos
   - Set the maximum number of images to load
   - Specify size options and sorting criteria
   - For "Load from Album", provide the album ID (see [How to Get Album ID](#how-to-get-album-id))
   - For "Search Photos", enter your search query (feature under development)
5. Run your workflow. The node will authenticate with Google Photos on first use.

## Node Options

- **Action**: Choose between listing albums, loading from an album, or searching photos.
- **Max Images**: Set the maximum number of images to load (1-100).
- **Size Option**: Choose between original size, custom size, or scale to size.
- **Target Width/Height**: Set custom dimensions for resizing.
- **Target Size**: Set the target size for scaling.
- **Use Crop**: Enable/disable cropping to maintain aspect ratio.
- **Sort Criteria**: Sort by creation time or filename.
- **Sort Order**: Choose ascending, descending, or random order.

## How to Get Album ID

To get the Album ID:

1. Set the node's action to "List Albums".
2. Connect the log output to a "Show Text" node.
3. Run the workflow.
4. Scroll down in the "Show Text" node output to see the full list of your library albums with their IDs.
5. Copy the ID of the desired album.
6. Change the node's action to "Load from Album".
7. Paste the copied ID into the "album_id" input of the node.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication issues, delete the `token.pickle` file in the node directory and rerun the workflow.
- Ensure your `client_secrets.json` file is correctly placed and formatted.
- Check the ComfyUI console for detailed logs if you enable the "Print Log" option in the node.
